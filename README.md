# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis was to work with Martha to create a report on types of cryptocurrencies on the trading market and group them together so the client investment bank can have a classification system for new investments.  Unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms are appropriate to use for this model because there is no known outcome.
